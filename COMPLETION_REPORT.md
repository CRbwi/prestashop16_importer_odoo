## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Dependencies and Configuration
- **Enhanced `__manifest__.py`**: Added `website`, `website_sale`, and `stock` dependencies
- **Proper module structure**: All unnecessary files removed, clean addon ready for production

### 2. Product Template Extensions (`product_template.py`)
```python
# NEW FIELDS ADDED:
is_published = fields.Boolean(default=True)  # Auto-publish on website
website_description = fields.Html()          # Website-specific descriptions
x_prestashop_product_id = fields.Integer()   # PrestaShop mapping (existing)
```

### 3. Import Logic Fixes (`prestashop_backend.py`)

#### ✅ Website Category Assignment Fixed
- **Before**: Incorrectly trying to assign to non-existent `categ_ids` field
- **After**: Proper detection and assignment to `public_categ_ids` or `website_categ_ids`

#### ✅ Product Description Handling Enhanced
- **Before**: Only `description_sale` populated
- **After**: Both `description_sale` AND `website_description` populated for full compatibility

#### ✅ Stock Import Completely Rewritten
- **Enhanced error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- **Improved location detection**: Better logic for finding internal stock locations
- **Cache invalidation**: Proper cache management for real-time stock updates
- **Robust quant management**: Create/update stock quants correctly

#### ✅ Website Publication Automated
- **New**: All imported products automatically set as `is_published = True`
- **Result**: Products immediately visible on website after import
