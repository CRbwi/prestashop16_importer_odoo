# PrestaShop 1.6 Importer - Test Results

## Test Date: May 29, 2025 - Live Testing Session

## Summary of Implemented Fixes

### 1. ✅ Dependencies Enhanced
- Added `website`, `website_sale`, and `stock` to `__manifest__.py`
- Ensures proper integration with Odoo's website and e-commerce functionality

### 2. ✅ Product Template Extended
- Added `is_published` field for website publication control
- Added `website_description` field for proper website content display
- These fields are automatically set during import

### 3. ✅ Import Logic Fixes

#### Subcategories/Website Categories
- **Fixed**: Product import now correctly assigns to `public_categ_ids` field

- **Solution**: Added proper field detection and assignment logic

#### Product Descriptions  
- **Fixed**: Both `description_sale` and `website_description` fields are populated
- **Previous Issue**: Descriptions not appearing correctly on website
- **Solution**: Added website-specific description field handling

#### Stock Import
- **Fixed**: Enhanced stock import with better error handling and cache invalidation
- **Previous Issue**: Stock quantities not importing correctly
- **Solution**: Improved location finding, quant management, and cache handling

#### Website Publication
- **Fixed**: Products are automatically set as published (`is_published = True`)
- **Previous Issue**: Imported products not visible on website
- **Solution**: Default publication status during import

### 4. ✅ Project Cleanup
- Removed ~40 unnecessary files (test files, documentation, backups, etc.)
- Cleaner project structure focused on core functionality
