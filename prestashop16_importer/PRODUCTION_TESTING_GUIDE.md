# üöÄ PRESTASHOP 1.6 IMPORTER - PRODUCTION TESTING GUIDE

## üìÖ Created: January 28, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ **CURRENT STATUS: READY FOR PRODUCTION TESTING**

All three critical issues have been implemented and the database transaction error has been fixed. The module is now ready for real-world testing.

---

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Odoo 18 server running
- ‚úÖ Prestashop 1.6 store with API enabled
- ‚úÖ Valid API credentials
- ‚úÖ Module installed and configured

### **Test Scenarios:**

#### **1. üñºÔ∏è Image Import Testing**
**What to test:**
- Products with single images
- Products with multiple images  
- Products without images
- Different image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Large image files

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Main product image appears in `image_1920` field
- ‚úÖ Additional images appear in product images gallery
- ‚úÖ No server errors during image download
- ‚úÖ Progress logging shows image processing status

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check Odoo logs for image processing messages
tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo.log | grep "üñºÔ∏è\|image"
```

#### **2. üè∑Ô∏è Category Assignment Testing**
**What to test:**
- Products assigned to single categories
- Products assigned to multiple categories
- Products without category assignments
- New categories vs existing categories

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Products appear in correct Odoo categories
- ‚úÖ Category mappings are properly created
- ‚úÖ No orphaned products (products without categories)
- ‚úÖ Progress logging shows category processing

**How to verify:**
1. Go to **Sales > Products > Products**
2. Check each imported product's **Product Category** field
3. Verify categories exist in **Sales > Configuration > Product Categories**

#### **3. üìÅ Category Hierarchy Testing**
**What to test:**
- Parent categories with subcategories
- Multi-level category hierarchies (parent > child > grandchild)
- Category ordering and structure
- Root category handling

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Prestashop category hierarchy is preserved in Odoo
- ‚úÖ Parent-child relationships are correctly established
- ‚úÖ No root categories (IDs 1, 2) imported
- ‚úÖ Category tree structure matches Prestashop

**How to verify:**
1. Go to **Sales > Configuration > Product Categories**
2. Check category tree structure
3. Compare with Prestashop category hierarchy

#### **4. üóÑÔ∏è Database Transaction Testing**
**What to test:**
- Import large product batches (100+ products)
- Multiple concurrent import operations
- Server restarts during import
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ No `psycopg2.errors.InFailedSqlTransaction` errors
- ‚úÖ Import operations complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Progress logging continues throughout import
- ‚úÖ Server remains stable

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Monitor Odoo server logs for transaction errors
tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo.log | grep -i "transaction\|error\|failed"
```

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Images not downloading:**
- Check network connectivity to Prestashop server
- Verify API image endpoints are accessible
- Check Odoo server disk space for image storage

#### **Categories not created:**
- Verify category API endpoints respond correctly
- Check for existing categories with same names
- Review category data structure in Prestashop

#### **Performance issues:**
- Monitor server resources during import
- Consider batch size reduction for large imports
- Check API rate limiting settings

---

## üìä **PERFORMANCE MONITORING**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Import time per product
- Memory usage during import
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates

### **Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check Odoo process memory usage
ps aux | grep odoo

# Monitor disk I/O
iotop

# Check database connections
psql -U odoo -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE application_name LIKE '%odoo%';"
```

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The module is considered fully functional when:

1. **Images:** All product images are successfully imported and displayed
2. **Categories:** Products are correctly assigned to their categories
3. **Hierarchy:** Category parent-child relationships are preserved
4. **Stability:** No database transaction errors occur
5. **Performance:** Import completes within reasonable time limits
6. **Logging:** Clear progress indication throughout the process

---

## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Start Production Testing:** Begin with a small product sample (10-20 products)
2. **Gradual Scale-Up:** Increase batch sizes based on initial results
3. **Monitor and Optimize:** Track performance and adjust if needed
4. **Document Results:** Record any issues or optimizations discovered
5. **Final Validation:** Confirm all three original issues are resolved

---

## üéØ **FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Images import correctly from Prestashop to Odoo
- [ ] Products are assigned to appropriate categories
- [ ] Prestashop subcategory hierarchy is respected
- [ ] No database transaction errors occur
- [ ] Import process completes successfully
- [ ] Server remains stable during and after import
- [ ] All logging and progress indication works correctly
