3. ‚úÖ **Subcategory Import**: Confirm correct website section assignments  
4. ‚úÖ **Image Import**: Test image handling and error recovery
5. ‚úÖ **Stock Import**: Verify inventory quantities import correctly
6. ‚úÖ **Website Integration**: Ensure products appear properly on website with descriptions
7. ‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Test graceful handling of failed imports
